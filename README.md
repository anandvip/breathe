     # Breath Patterns – Comparison Grid
     A single‑file, responsive webpage that presents four breath patterns from a transcript as grid‑structured cards. Each row uses a distinct border color to improve legibility and separation on mobile devices. Built with pure HTML/CSS (no JS dependencies). Uses CSS Grid for both the outer table and inner label/value layout.

     ## Customize
     - Add more patterns by duplicating an `<article class="row ...">` block and assigning a new `--row-clr` via class.
     - Tweak spacing with `--grid-gap`, radius with `--radius`, and backdrop via `--bg`.

     ## License
     - Intended for personal documentation/educational display within the Vipul project.
